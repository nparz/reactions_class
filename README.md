compile code "runge_kutta.f90" 
using:

gfortran runge_kutta.f90 


run: 

./a.out


makes three output files, the wavefunctions at E=0.1,3.0 and the phaseshifts
I've included several plots as well. 



The one resonance appears at L=2, with 

E = 1.39 MeV 
Gamma = 0.26 MeV 

lifetime = 2.53e-21 s 

That's rather short... 

I've included a plot that compares the Breit-Wigner distribution with the distribution from the calculation. 

Let me know if you guys get anything different.
